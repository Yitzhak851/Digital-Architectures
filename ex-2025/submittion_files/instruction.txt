Starting from address 0x10000100 resides an array of integers. The size of the array is 
written in address 0x10000000. You should sum up all the elements that have even 
values in the array and write the result to address 0x10000004. 


Starting from address 0x10000100 resides an array of integers. 
The size of the array is written in address 0x10000000. 
You should sum up all the elements that have even values in the array 
and write the result to address 0x10000004.

This is a programming task 
where the goal is to process an array stored in memory 
and calculate the sum of its even elements. 
The instructions specify:

1.	Array Location and Size:
o	The array starts at memory address 0x10000100.
o	The size of the array (num_of_val) is stored at memory address 0x10000000.
2.	Output:
o	Sum of all even values in the array 
o	Written them to memory address 0x10000004.
