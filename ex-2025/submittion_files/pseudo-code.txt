Hereâ€™s the pseudocode and the assembly solution for the given problem.

#### ------- Pseudocode ------- ####

    1. Read the size of the array from address 0x10000000.
    2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
    3. Set a pointer to the starting address of the array, 0x10000100.
    4. Loop through the array:
        a. Read the current element.
        b. If (the element is even)
            add it to `sum`
        c. else:
            Move to the next element (increment the pointer).
    5. Write the value of `sum` to address 0x10000004.
