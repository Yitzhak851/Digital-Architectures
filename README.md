# Digital-Architectures #
In the course we first discuss Boolean algebra and the implementation of Boolean equations using gates. <br>
Then we use gates to build the basic building blocks of a digital computer, <br>
e.g., Multiplexors, Decoders, Arithmetic Logic Unit, Registers, Counters, State-Machines etc. <br>
At this stage we are ready to build a CPU. <br>
We introduce the instruction set of a RISC CPU, the MIPS, which is the one we intend to build in class. <br>
This CPU is very similar to the RISC-V, today's open-source computer architecture model. <br>
We discuss the steps of converting a high level program into machine language and the mechanism needed to support subroutines. <br>
This is followed by implementation of a basic single cycle MIPS in which the data path and the control part are designed in detail. <br>
The next stage is a multi-cycle implementation of the same CPU, including exceptions and interrupts handling. <br>
Eventually we discuss pipelining basics.
